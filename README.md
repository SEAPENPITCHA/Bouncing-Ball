# Bouncing-Ball

# Intro
We learnt how to draw basic shape, catch actions, and generate timer 
interrupt. Now we will have to try to practice using them. You are going 
to extend the exercise of graphics 2D that you created one ball 
bouncing in a frame. Now you have to add the following feature to the 
exercise.

# Feature
• You have to be able to make ball move at different speeds. Each ball 
has its own speed.
• You have to make multi-color balls. Each ball has its own color. 
• Bouncing should be correct. Ball should not sink into wall.
• When you left click on your mouse, you have to create a new ball at 
the mouse position with random speed.
• When you right click, you will remove the oldest ball from the frame.
• *** Extra point if you can separate drawing from updating position
